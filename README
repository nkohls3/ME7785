# Lidar and Computer Vision Navigation

It will train and test each time you run the code

The robot will recognize the use lidar to stay within the walls and computer vision to read and navigate the course. 

example_knn.py - This code runs considering the full image without any processing. The KNN classifier acts only on the raw picture pixel intensity values. The resulting model achieves around 1/4 accuracy (slightly better than random guessing, 1/5).

There are two ways to run this code:

1) With visualization of fed images:
python croppedKNN.py

2) Without visualization of fed images:
python -O croppedKNN.py

NOTE: here the -O is the capital letter not zero.
